🔬 As a devoted researcher in the field of energy storage systems, I focus on the characterization of physicochemical phenomena within energy storage systems, particularly through the use of optical sensors.

📚 Currently, I am a CNRS Research Scientist at the Solid State and Energy Chemistry Lab at Collège de France. My work revolves around enhancing diagnostics for energy storage technologies to aid in the development of more durable and efficient batteries.

🎓 Education:

PhD in Energetics and Processes from Mines Paris - PSL (2017-2020), focusing on new anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.
Master’s Degree in Engineering from ECPM Ecole européenne de chimie polymères et matériaux de Strasbourg (2013-2017), where I also led the ECPM Junior Company Association.
Pre-engineering studies at Paris-Sud University (2011-2013) with involvement in various student activities and societies.
🌍 Professional Experience:

Chargée de recherche CNRS at CNRS (2025 - Present), enhancing battery monitoring technologies.
Postdoctoral Researcher at UC San Diego (2023 - 2025), expanding the use of fiber optic characterizations in novel energy storage systems.
Postdoctoral Researcher at Collège de France (2020 - 2022), pioneering sensor technology for real-time battery degradation monitoring.
Plus earlier roles at Safran, CEA, Deakin University, and Bosch, contributing to various aspects of battery technology research.
🛠️ Selected Projects:

INFRALYTICS: Spearheading this ERC project to integrate Evanescent Wave Infrared Fiber Optic Spectroscopy into commercial batteries, aiming to monitor and understand the intricate chemical dynamics that affect battery life and performance.
