Our recent study presented at the ECS Meeting Abstracts, 2024 focuses on the role of the active lithium reservoir in enhancing the longevity and efficiency of anode-free pouch cells, which are a promising direction for high-density energy storage solutions.

## Overview
The study investigates the unique challenges of anode-free batteries that operate without a traditional anode, using copper foil instead to plate lithium directly from the cathode. This configuration offers higher energy densities but presents challenges in terms of cycle life due to lithium loss.

## Methodology
Utilizing techniques such as titration gas chromatography and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy, our team has explored the behavior of active lithium and its impact on battery performance. By measuring the lithium reservoir at different stages of battery use, we provide insights into the optimization of these power sources.

## Key Findings
- **Active Lithium Quantification:** The presence of active lithium at the anode and its quantification can significantly influence the battery's performance.
- **Coulombic Efficiency (CE) and Capacity Retention:** Understanding the first-cycle irreversibility and subsequent lithium plating/stripping efficiency helps in shaping the capacity retention curves, which are crucial for assessing the battery's longevity.

## Impact
This research not only broadens our understanding of lithium dynamics in novel battery systems but also opens up pathways for enhancing the durability and safety of anode-free lithium batteries. The findings have implications for developing battery systems with higher energy efficiency and more stable performance under various operational conditions.
