Our recent publication in *Nature Energy* introduces a novel operando infrared fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy (FEWS) method, utilizing it to monitor dynamic chemical changes inside commercial Na(Li)-ion batteries under real working conditions.

## Overview
This study showcases the application of fiber optic infrared spectroscopy, a technique traditionally used in the medical field, adapted here to enhance the understanding and performance of Na(Li)-ion batteries.

## Methodology
The research implemented chalcogenide glass fibers, which permit a broader transmission window compared to traditional silica fibers, to track chemical dynamics during battery operation. These fibers were integrated directly into the batteries, allowing for unprecedented real-time monitoring of the electrolyte and electrode material interactions.

## Key Findings
- **Chemical Species Identification:** The spectroscopy technique identified various chemical species and their transformations during battery cycling, providing insights into the formation and evolution of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI).
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** The study demonstrated the ability to monitor changes in the Na(Li) inventory and electrolyte stability, offering a deeper understanding of battery chemistry under various cycling conditions.

## Impact
This research paves the way for improved battery diagnostics and has potential implications for enhancing battery design, extending battery life, and optimizing performance through better understanding of the internal chemical processes.
