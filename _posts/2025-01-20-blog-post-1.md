The European Research Council (ERC) has recently awarded a Starting Grant for the innovative project INFRALYTICS, which aims to transform our approach to battery health diagnostics through advanced infrared spectroscopy. This pioneering research not only enhances our understanding of battery mechanics but also paves the way for more sustainable energy solutions.

## A New Era in Battery Diagnostics

INFRALYTICS leverages the power of infrared fiber optic spectroscopy to delve into the chemical processes within batteries during their operational cycles. By capturing detailed molecular changes, this approach seeks to provide real-time data on battery health and efficiency, a breakthrough in the maintenance and longevity of battery systems.

## Advancing Renewable Energy Technologies

The implications of such detailed insights are vast, ranging from improved battery performance and lifespan to enhanced safety protocols. As the world shifts towards renewable energy sources, the need for efficient and reliable energy storage systems becomes ever more critical. The INFRALYTICS project represents a significant step forward in meeting these technological and environmental challenges.
